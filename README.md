# Osu! API React Project #

A react project which takes a beatmap link from the osu website and sends it to someone in game via in game DMs. Code and front end is not the greatest but it was one of my first react projects that started as a todo list. Planning to revisit and rewrite the code and add a database so I can save all the requested maps somewhere and maybe add filters and a randomizer to recommend maps.
