# Osu! API React Project #

A react project which takes a beatmap link from the osu website and sends it to someone in game via in game DMs. Code and front end is not the greatest but it was one of my first react projects that started as a todo list. Currently working on it on my free time!

## To do list : ##
* Add log in via twitch and not being able to post a map without being logged in(almost done!!)
* ~~Save to database (maybe save osu ign too)~~ DONE!! users now are saved to DB maps too! Trying to find a way to have a "requested by" string too.
* Make looks a bit better
