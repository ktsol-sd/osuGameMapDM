# Osu! API React Project #

A react project which takes a beatmap link from the osu website and sends it to someone in game via in game DMs. Code and front end is not the greatest but it was one of my first react projects that started as a todo list. Currently working on it on my free time!

## To do list : ##
* Add log in via twitch
* Save to database (maybe save osu ign too)
* Show user all the maps they suggested and how long ago
* Make looks a bit better
